## Objective
There's a door that needs opening on Space Island! Talk to Jewel Loggins there for more information.

## Solution
- We get the following paraphrase from the AD challenge
```
And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height.'
And he'll silently take his way.
```
- We can find a sample audio of Wombley Cube in Chiaroscuro City where is presented ```"The Enchanted Voyage of Santa and his Elves to the Geese Islands."```
- We can use the following service to fake his voice https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlphaDragon/Voice-Clone
- Next we play the audio ( upload the audio file ) in Space Point Locked Door and we will be granted access.
